When we began our budget, we searched online for a list of categories to help us get started. Our search turned up
plenty of lists, but most of them were either too short or they were embedded in spreadsheets. It was difficult
(for us at least) to locate a simple list on a web page. So, to help others like ourselves, we've decided to post our
budget categories below.
